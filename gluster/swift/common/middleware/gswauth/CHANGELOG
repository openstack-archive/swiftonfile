swauth (1.0.8)

   Added request.environ[reseller_request] = True if request is coming from an
   user in .reseller_admin group

   Fixed to work with newer Swift versions whose memcache clients require a
   time keyword argument when the older versions required a timeout keyword
   argument.

swauth (1.0.7)

    New X-Auth-Token-Lifetime header a user can set to how long they'd like
    their token to be good for.

    New max_token_life config value for capping the above.

    New X-Auth-Token-Expires header returned with the get token request.

    Switchover to swift.common.swob instead of WebOb; requires Swift >= 1.7.6
    now.

swauth (1.0.6)

    Apparently I haven't been keeping up with this CHANGELOG. I'll try to be
    better onward.

    This release added passing OPTIONS requests through untouched, needed for
    CORS support in Swift.

    Also, Swauth is a bit more restrictive in deciding when it's the definitive
    auth for a request.

swauth (1.0.3-dev)

    This release is still under development. A full change log will be made at
    release. Until then, you can see what has changed with:

    git log 1.0.2..HEAD

swauth (1.0.2)

    Fixed bug rejecting requests when using multiple instances of Swauth or
    Swauth with other auth services.

    Fixed bug interpreting URL-encoded user names and keys.

    Added support for the Swift container sync feature.

    Allowed /not/ setting super_admin_key to disable Swauth administration
    features.

    Added swauth_remote mode so the Swauth middleware for one Swift cluster
    could be pointing to the Swauth service on another Swift cluster, sharing
    account/user data sets.

    Added ability to purge stored tokens.

    Added API documentation for internal Swauth API.

swauth (1.0.1)

    Initial release after separation from Swift.
