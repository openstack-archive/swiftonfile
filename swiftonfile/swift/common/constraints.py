# The longest filename supported by XFS in 255.

# SoF creates a temp file with following naming convention:
# .OBJECT_NAME.<random-string>
# The random string is 32 character long and and file name has two dots.
# Hence 255 - 32 - 2 = 221
# NOTE: This limitation can be sefely raised by having slashes in really long
# object name. Each segment between slashes ('/') should not exceed 221.
