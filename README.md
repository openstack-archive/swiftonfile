# Swift-on-File
Swift-on-File is a Swift Object Server implementation that enables users to
access the same data, both as an object and as a file. Data can be stored and
retrieved through Swift's REST interface or as files from NAS interfaces
including native GlusterFS, GPFS, NFS and CIFS.

Swift-on-File is to be deployed as a Swift [storage policy](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/overview_policies.html),
which provides the advantages of being able to extend an existing Swift cluster
and also migrating data to and from policies with different storage backends.

The main difference from the default Swift Object Server is that Swift-on-File
stores objects following the same path hierarchy as the object's URL. In contrast,
the default Swift implementation stores the object following the mapping given
by the Ring, and its final file path is unkown to the user.

For example, an object with URL: `https://swift.example.com/v1/acct/cont/obj`,
would be stored the following way by the two systems:
* Swift: `/mnt/sdb1/2/node/sdb2/objects/981/f79/f566bd022b9285b05e665fd7b843bf79/1401254393.89313.data`
* SoF: `/mnt/swiftonfile/acct/cont/obj`

## Use cases
Swift-on-File can be especially useful in cases where access over multiple
protocols is desired. For example, imagine a deployment where video files
are uploaded as objects over Swift's REST interface and a legacy video transcoding
software access those videos as files.

Along the same lines, data can be ingested over Swift's REST interface and then
analytic software like Hadoop can operate directly on the data without having to
move the data to a separate location.

Another use case is where users might need to migrate data from an existing file
storage systems to a Swift cluster.

Similarly, scientific applications may process file data and then select some or all
of the data to publish to outside users through the swift interface.

## Limitations and Future plans
Swift-On-File currently works only with Filesystems with extended attributes
support. It is also recommended that these Filesystems provide data durability
as Swift-On-File should not use Swift's replication mechanisms. 

GlusterFS and GPFS are good examples of Filesystems that work well with Swift-on-File.
Both provide a posix interface, global namespace, scalability, data replication
and support for extended attributes.

Currently, files added over a file interface (e.g., native GlusterFS), do not show
up in container listings, still those files would be accessible over Swift's REST
interface with a GET request. We are working to provide a solution to this limitation.

There is also subtle but very important difference in the implementation of
[last write wins](doc/markdown/last_write_wins.md) behaviour when compared to
OpenStack Swift.

Because Swift-On-File relies on the data replication support of the filesystem the Swift
Object replicator process does not have any role for containers using the Swift-on-File
storage policy.  This means that Swift geo replication is not available to objects in
in containers using the Swift-on-File storage policy.  Multi-site replication for these
objects must be provided by the filesystem.

Future plans includes adding support for Filesystems without extended attributes,
which should extend the ability to migrate data for legacy storage systems.
